    Belt Publishing is a small, independent press founded in Cleveland in 2013 as a platform for new and influential
    voices from the Rust Belt and Midwest. As with our sister publication, Belt Magazine, we are committed to carefully
    edited, complex writing. We believe in quality over quantity and community over analytics. Our titles have been
    praised by the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>The Daily Beast</em>, <em>Ebony</em>,
    <em>Ploughshares</em>, and numerous other publications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our growing catalog of original titles includes four core imprints. The
    <a href="https://beltpublishing.com/collections/city-anthology-series">City Anthology Series</a> compiles essays
    from homegrown and expat writers about the cities they love.
    <a href="https://beltpublishing.com/collections/neighborhood-guidebook-series">Neighborhood Guidebooks</a> explore
    the smaller enclaves that form the larger cultural identities of major cities.
    <a href="https://beltpublishing.com/collections/notches-a-belt-publishing-imprint">Notches</a> publishes "shortform"
    books (or, perhaps, "really longform essays") by some of the nation's best writers about often overlooked subjects
    of interest to the Midwest. <a href="https://beltpublishing.com/collections/belt-revivals">Belt Revivals</a> brings
    back influential works from the past that illuminate the present and inform our future.

    "For the past five years, a small press called Belt Publishing has been bringing out intriguing nonfiction books
    about the Midwest; now they've started a new series called Belt Revivals to publish classic Midwestern fiction as
    well as nonfiction."

    "Small presses across Appalachia and the Rust Belt consistently publish, to little fanfare, incredibly diverse work
    - books that are lush, gritty, surprising and so very true. Perhaps the best example, or certainly the best place to
    begin, is Catte’s “What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia.” This edgy, meticulous work of nonfiction from
    Cleveland’s Belt Publishing dispels many myths about the region."
